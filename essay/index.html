    <h1>The Computer Writes a New Old Language</h1>
</div>
<div class="note">
    <p>There is an idea about poetry, developed relatively recently in
the human story, that it is the result of a mind making something
new: a mind expressing itself, channelling inspiration into
original creation, interacting with the world as a sovereign entity
exerting its aesthetic will, being an author. This idea of
authorship tends to mislead us when we think about computers
making poetry. When we see a poem that has been, as we say,
“written by a computer”, we immediately imagine an advanced
thinking engine, possibly in a chic humanoid shell, churning its
many layers of numbers to think thoughts beyond human
understanding, authoring art to rival our own, inevitably rising to
destroy/master/transcend the limitations of flesh, &amp;c.</p>
<p>But there is an older idea of poetry – of art – which can maybe
take us somewhere more useful, for now: that poetry is the craft
of combining inherited and accepted elements in exciting ways,
displaying the poet’s skill in memory and recombination, with
new flourishes and touches of original language introduced
rarely and judiciously, only when they enhance the poet’s and
audience’s connection to the deep, historic whole. This
approach to poetry is why the sagas reproduce the same
kennings over and over, why the Odyssey’s dawn is always
rosy-fingered, why the battles in the border ballads seem
curiously alike even when conducted by different characters in
different wars. This is also why alliteration, assonance, rhythm
and rhyme exist (have you ever tried to memorise an epic
without them?)</p>
<p>This idea of art as interesting recombination rather than original
creation helps us to understand computer poetry better. What
our poetic machines do now is to combine and recombine the
elements of language, with programmers to push them to do it
in more interesting ways and editors to help weed out the duller
or clunkier results. Computers can write poetry in much the
same way as poets have always done, by taking the poetry that
already exists, making sense of how it works, breaking it into its
elements and putting it back together in interesting ways.</p>
<p>But creating this binary system of recombination and creation,
craft and art, natural and unnatural, risks, as all such systems
do, ignoring the ways the two halves are always making and
collapsing into each other, especially when the binary is given a
pseudo-historical linear development, as with this introduction.</p>
<p>There is, after all, no creation that isn’t an extremely
complicated act of recombination, and no recombination that
doesn’t require some kind of authorial creation. And so to think
hard about this history of poetry is also to think hard about
poetry’s material: language.</p>
<p>The poets of minority languages, especially those minority
languages like Scots which are subject to progressive erasure –
linguaphagy – by a larger and more successful linguistic
neighbour, embrace a variety of tactics to recover their tongues.
There is retraining your ears to hear what is actually spoken by
your friends, rather than what the dominant orthography thinks
is spoken; there is mining the literature and the lexicons for
words that are nearly lost; there is creating new and old-new
words to express what would have been going to be expressed
had the languages taken a different path through history. There
is, in deploying these tactics, a negotiation between the poet
and the audience’s almost-understanding so that
communication takes place. As the words unroll, it’s never
entirely clear whether anyone really understands what they
really mean, or rather, whether the conditions currently exist to
realise the potential for meaning within them – the potential
which has been lost, which is being recovered, and which is
imagined into the future by the very act of speaking.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that the understanding of Scots as a
“synthetic” language is to make the same peculiar and
politically-loaded binary assumptions about language as we
have become accustomed to make about art: that there is either
natural language that evolves by itself through recombinatorial
development or synthetic language that’s created by an author
sui generis and ex nihilo. But, of course, linguistic change was
always shaped by poets’ creativity, and poets’ new languages
always had deeper foundations in the vernacular and historic
than they or others would care to admit.</p>
<p>When a computer program attempts to write in a minority
language, it appears gloriously shod of all the political biases of
the poets making the same attempts: the computer does not
“understand” English any more than it “understands” Scots: it
only knows the patterns of symbols and what patterns are likely
to follow those patterns. But programs are written by people,
and when, as in this case, one is using systems developed by
the American military to deduce the pronunciation of written
text, the politicised results are visible in the jankiness of its
rhyme schemes, and when the computer has been tuned to
match a corpus that cannot decide how to spell a Scots word
because it was written at a time of crucial transition between
Scots and English as the local lingua franca, the ballads
frequently wander down orthographical cul-de-sacs which even
the program’s authors cannot identify as either Scots or
otherwise.</p>
<p>This is what we’ve done: we met in the contested border town
of Berwick-Upon-Tweed, built a computer program from
repurposed old code and self-authored new code, tweaked and
tuned it to best fit the entire ballad text of Walter Scott’s
Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, and set it to write some new
ballads in the same form and language. In doing so, we are
asking of it no more than was expected of the ballads’ first
singers; in recording the results, we are as partial and editorial
as Scott. We hope that the program’s many successes and
many failures, and in particular the messy border zones
between success and failure, teach us something about
language, something about poetry, and everything about what it
means to create.</p>
